Description: Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol library
 OPeNDAP provides software that allows you to access data over the internet,
 from programs that weren't originally designed for that purpose, as well 
 as some that were. While OPeNDAP is the original developer of the Data Access
 protocol which its software uses, many other groups have adopted DAP
 and provide compatible clients, servers and software development kits. 
 .
 With OPeNDAP software, you access data using a URL, just like a URL you
 would use to access a web page. However, before you request any data, 
 you need to know how to request it in a form your browser can handle. 
 OPeNDAP data is stored in binary form, and by default, it is 
 transmitted that way, too.
